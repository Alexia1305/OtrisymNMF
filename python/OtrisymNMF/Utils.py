    Solves the following optimization problem:
    min_{norm2v >= 0, V >= 0 and VV^T = D} ||M - U * V||_F^2

    Parameters:
        M (numpy.ndarray): Matrix M of size (m, n).
        U (numpy.ndarray): Matrix U of size (m, r).
        Mn (numpy.ndarray, optional): Normalized columns of M. If None, it will be computed.

    Returns:
        V (numpy.ndarray): The matrix V of size (r, n) that approximates M.
        norm2v (numpy.ndarray): The squared norms of the columns of V.
